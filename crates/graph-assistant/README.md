# Use Qwen to help modify dot files.

The graph-assistant crate can:
   - Parse DOT strings with quoted identifiers.
   - Represent the graph in a convenient NamedGraph structure.
   - Allow for programmatic modification (adding nodes/edges).
   - Handle subgraph assignments.
   - Parse edge labels.
   - Serialize the graph back into a well-formed DOT string that includes subgraphs and labels.
